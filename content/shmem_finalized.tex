\apidescription{
  The \FUNC{shmem\_finalized} routine returns a value indicating
  whether the \openshmem library has been finalized (i.e, a call to
  \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} has completed successfully).
  This routine may be called at any point in an \openshmem program,
  including before \FUNC{shmem\_init[\_thread]} and after
  \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}.
  This routine may be called by any thread of execution in the
  \ac{PE}, independent of the level of thread support provided by the
  implementation.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  Returns \CONST{1} if the \openshmem library has been finalized;
  otherwise, returns \CONST{0}.
}
